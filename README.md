# Customer-Churn-Prediction
# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning | End-to-End Python Project

Customer Churn Prediction Project using Machine Learning in Python! 
Customer churn prediction is a crucial business problem for companies that rely on subscription or recurring customers. This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (stop using a service) based on their behavior, demographics, and interaction data.
In this full end-to-end project, we’ll predict customer churn using real-world bank data and explore how data-driven insights can help businesses retain their valuable customers.

# Objectives
How to preprocess and clean structured data
Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns
Engineer meaningful features like Balance, Tenure, and Product Usage
Build and compare ML models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
Visualize churn trends and customer behavior using Seaborn & Matplotlib
Understand how businesses can use churn prediction for customer retention strategies
